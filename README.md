This app is optimized for PC. I don't recommend for use with smartphones. If you used the app with your smartphones, Its UI may do not doing good.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### To using with Windows
You need to build msix package or compile. But I couldn't upload all files. Thus you'll probably need to fix this app before compilingðŸ’¦
